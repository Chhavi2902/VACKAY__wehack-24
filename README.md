Developed VACKAY to address critical gaps in the digital travel space, including
authenticity issues, the absence of a dedicated traveler social media platform, and a
shortage of long-form travel content. Leveraged gamification to authenticate content and
foster genuine experiences, integrated a reservation platform for seamless booking, and
introduced personalized yearly recaps for enhanced user engagement. Implemented with
HTML, CSS, JavaScript, D3, TopoJSON, and DataStamps to offer a unique and
comprehensive solution to the challenges faced by travelers. VACKAY stands out with its
emphasis on authenticity, user engagement, and personalized experiences, filling a
significant void in the travel industry.
